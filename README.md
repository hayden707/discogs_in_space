## Purpose
Crate Dig is a personal project created as an exercise in working with a 3rd party API, React, and Tailwind. As an avid record collector I chose the Discogs API, and created a new front-end with which users can search for all official releases put out by an artist.

## What I learned
This was the first project in which I used a CCS framework (Tailwind). Tailwind simplified my front-end coding and was much easier to learn that I expected.

Crate Dig was also the first project in which I integrated a 3rd party API on my own with no outside help. In doing so, I ran into many problems that I had to find solutions for myself. I had hiccups with authentication, accessing specific data, integrating YouTube links, etc. In solving these problems, I learned a lot about API integration. While every once in a while a search fails, for the most part the site runs as I hoped it would.

## Future Updates
Since this project was built to practice a few narrow concepts I probably won't be making future updates. However, if I decide to, I would like to use Auth0 so that users with Discogs accounts can sign in via their account and create lists of albums and make the site more interactive and social. I would also expand the search function so that users can search by song, album title, and label. I also would like to embed Youtube videos instead of only using links.
